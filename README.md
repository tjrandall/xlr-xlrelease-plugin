# Preface #

This document describes the functionality provided by the xlr-xlr-plugin.

See the **[XL Release Documentation](https://docs.xebialabs.com/xl-release/index.html)** for background information on XL Release and release concepts.

# Overview #

The xlr-xlr-plugin is an XL Release plugin that allows you to:
  * programmatically create a template and assign tags to it
  * create and start another release from an existing release, and wait for the subrelease to complete before continuing in the current release. (create a subrelease from a parent release)
  * programmatically delete phases in the current release
  * create and start a parallel from an existing release.  This allows the current release to keep processing, while other release processes begin.

## Tasks ##
+ Create and Start SubRelease
  * `templateName`: Name of the template from which to create the subrelease (`string`) 
  * `releaseTitle`: Name of the subrelease (`string`)
  * `releaseDescription`: Description of the subrelease (`string`)
  * `variables`: Comma-separated key-value pairs for the values of variables required by the subrelease, e.g. var1=value1,var2=value2 (`string`)

+ Create Template
  * `templateName`: Name of the template to create (`string`)
  * `tags`: Comma-separated list of tags to associate with this template e.g. tag1,tag2 (`string`)
